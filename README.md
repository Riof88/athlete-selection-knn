# Athlete Selection – KNN Model

This project explores athlete data to help with selection decisions using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.  
The goal is to identify the nearest neighbors of a given athlete based on performance features.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Applying KNN with `sklearn`
- Identifying top 3 nearest athletes
- Understanding model performance and accuracy

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains physical performance metrics for athletes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks (Kaggle)

## 🏷️ Tags / Labels
`KNN` `Machine Learning` `Classification` `Athlete Data` `Sklearn` `Beginner Project` `Sports Analytics`
